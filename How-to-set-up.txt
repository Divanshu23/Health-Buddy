How To Set Up
---------------------
Note, Bootstrap should be already in, but nothing has been used to style.

1. Ensure the css and js files are in the correct folder and named correctly!
2. Ensure the firebase script src's are correct. (the last 3 script tags in the html)

firebase.js
---------------
For this to work, I created a firebase with REAL-TIME DATABASE, not cloud-database!
1. Ensure the "firebaseConfig" is configured to the your database (not mine!)

Functions
--------------
writeData(): Grabs the value inside the input tag and loads it into the real-time database.

readData(): This function will grab all the data inside the real-time Database
and outputs it inside the div tag.


Not really a function, but...
In the Chat.html, in the form, there's a clear all button.
onclick="db.remove()" : this will DELETE all the data inside the real-time database.
you can make it a feature, but it's mostly for debugging.
